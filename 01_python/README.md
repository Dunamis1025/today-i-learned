# 🐍 Python Learning Track

This folder contains my structured learning progress in **Python programming**,  
including core language fundamentals, Pygame, and Tkinter GUI development.

The goal of this section is to build a strong Python foundation  
before moving on to more complex projects and applications.

## 🧠 Learning Notes

- Folder names are **numbered** to reflect the learning order  
- This is a **learning-focused structure**, not a production project  
- Code is written by following tutorials and typing everything manually  
- Some folders include **screenshots** to document visual behavior
