🐍 Python Basics

This folder contains foundational Python practice files created while following the
“Nado Coding (나도코딩)” YouTube tutorial series.

The purpose of this folder is to build a solid understanding of Python fundamentals
before moving on to larger, project-based implementations.

🎯 Purpose

Practice core Python syntax and concepts

Understand how Python code flows step by step

Get comfortable writing, reading, and organizing small scripts

Build a strong foundation before starting CLI-based projects

📚 Topics Covered
🔹 Core Language Basics

Variables and data types

String formatting (%, format(), f-strings)

Conditional statements (if / elif / else)

Loops (for, while, break, continue)

🔹 Input & Output

User input and console output

Text file reading and writing

File handling using open() and the with statement

Encoding handling with UTF-8

🔹 Data Handling

Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries

Nested data structures

Object serialization using pickle

Saving and loading Python objects from files

🔹 Practical Concepts

Basic program flow control

Writing small, focused scripts

Understanding how data moves through a program

Reading error messages and fixing simple bugs

📌 Learning Approach

All files are learning exercises, not polished applications

Code was typed and tested line by line to ensure understanding

Each script focuses on one core concept at a time

Emphasis on clarity over complexity

🚀 Next Step

This folder marks the end of basic Python syntax practice.

From here, learning continues with project-based development, starting with:

A StarCraft-inspired CLI project

Defining units as Python classes

Simulating attacks and damage calculations

Printing battle results in the terminal (e.g. “Marine took 10 damage”)

The next project will be organized in a separate folder to keep concepts clearly structured.
