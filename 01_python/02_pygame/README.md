# Pygame Learning Overview

This folder contains Pygame-related learning materials organized into
two main sections: basic concept practice and a small game project.

The goal is to first understand individual Pygame concepts and then
apply them together in a step-by-step project.

## Folder Structure

### 01_pygame_basic
This folder contains small, focused examples for learning core Pygame concepts,
such as:

- Creating a game window and frame
- Drawing backgrounds and sprites
- Handling keyboard events
- Controlling frame rate (FPS)
- Collision detection
- Rendering text on the screen

Each file focuses on a single concept for easier understanding.

### 02_pygame_project
This folder contains a step-by-step game project that combines the concepts
learned in `01_pygame_basic`.

Each Python file represents a development stage of the game, gradually adding
new features such as weapon handling, ball movement, collision logic, and
game-over conditions.

## Notes

These examples were created as learning exercises while following the
"Nado Coding" Pygame tutorial series.

The focus of this folder is learning game development fundamentals rather than
building a polished or commercial game.
