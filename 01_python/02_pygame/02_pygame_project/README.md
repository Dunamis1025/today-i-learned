# Pygame Project – Step-by-Step Game Development

This folder contains a small Pygame project built by gradually combining
individual concepts learned from basic Pygame examples.

Each file represents a development step in the game, following a
step-by-step learning approach.

## Project Structure

- `01_frame_background_stage_character.py`  
  Set up the game window, background, stage, and character.

- `02_weapon_keyevent.py`  
  Add weapon movement and keyboard input handling.

- `03_ball_movement.py`  
  Implement ball movement with basic physics.

- `04_collision.py`  
  Handle collision detection between the character, weapon, and balls.

- `05_ball_division.py`  
  Split balls into smaller ones when hit by a weapon.

- `06_gameover.py`  
  Add game over conditions and finishing logic.

## Assets

- `images/`  
  Contains all image assets used in the project (background, character,
  balls, weapons, etc.).

## Notes

This project was created as a learning exercise while following the
"Nado Coding" Pygame tutorial series.

The focus is on understanding game loops, event handling, collision logic,
and incremental game development rather than creating a complete commercial
game.
