# Today I Learned (TIL)

This repository is a personal learning log where I upload small, daily code examples
to practice GitHub commits and improve my programming fundamentals.

## 📌 Purpose

- Practice making small, consistent commits on GitHub
- Learn Python and Pygame basics step by step
- Keep a clear record of what I learned each day

## 🎮 Pygame Basics

The `pygame_basic` folder contains Python files created while following
the **"Nado Coding (나도코딩)" YouTube tutorial**.

These files are not original projects, but **learning exercises**
typed and understood line by line.

Topics covered include:
- Creating a game window
- Drawing backgrounds and sprites
- Keyboard input handling
- Frame rate (FPS) control
- Collision detection using `Rect`
- Text rendering and timers
- Basic game loop structure
