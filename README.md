# Today I Learned (TIL)

This repository is a personal learning log where I upload small, daily code examples
while studying Python fundamentals, Pygame, and GUI programming.

The main purpose of this repository is:
- to practice consistent GitHub commits
- to review and reinforce programming basics
- to keep a clear, structured record of what I have learned
