# 📊 Excel Automation Study (openpyxl)

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains structured practice files covering Excel automation using Python and the openpyxl library.

The goal of this study track was to understand how to programmatically create, modify, analyze, and format Excel files without manual interaction.

This study represents the completion of the Excel Automation learning phase.

## 📚 What I Learned

Throughout these practice files, I developed the ability to:

- Create new Excel files
- Open and modify existing files
- Work with worksheets and sheet management
- Access and manipulate cell values
- Handle row and column operations (insert, delete, move)
- Apply cell styles and formatting
- Use conditional formatting
- Freeze panes
- Merge and unmerge cells
- Insert images into Excel
- Create charts (e.g., line chart)
- Read formula results using data_only option
- Process structured data (e.g., grade processing project)

## 📂 Learning Flow

The study progressed in the following structured order:

1. Basic file creation
2. Sheet operations
3. Reading and writing cell values
4. Working with ranges and coordinates
5. Row and column manipulation
6. Cell styling and formatting
7. Advanced formatting (conditional formatting, freeze panes)
8. Charts and data visualization
9. Formula result handling
10. Data processing automation project

The final project (`grade_processing_quiz.py`) demonstrates practical data processing automation using Excel files.

## 🎯 Final Project Summary

The grade processing automation project includes:

- Reading structured student data
- Applying score calculations
- Updating results programmatically
- Saving processed output file

This project simulates real-world business data processing workflows.

## ⚠ Important Notes

- openpyxl does not evaluate formulas; it reads stored results.
- Large Excel files may require performance optimization.
- Styling operations increase processing time.
- Images inserted must be properly referenced and sized.
