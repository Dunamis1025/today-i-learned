# 🖥 Desktop GUI Automation Study (PyAutoGUI)

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains 19 practice files covering desktop GUI automation using Python and PyAutoGUI.

The goal of this study track was to understand how real-world RPA (Robotic Process Automation) works by automating mouse, keyboard, window, and image-based interactions on a Windows desktop environment.

This is not just simple scripting practice — it represents a structured learning progression toward practical automation skills.

## 📚 What I Learned

Throughout these 19 files, I practiced:

- Mouse control (click, move, drag, scroll)
- Keyboard automation
- Hotkey execution
- Window control (maximize, close, detect)
- Image recognition (locateOnScreen)
- Screen capture and detection confidence tuning
- Handling Korean text input via clipboard
- Basic exception handling
- Timing control and execution flow management
- Realistic desktop workflow automation

## 📂 File Progression Structure

The learning flow followed this order:

1. Basic mouse movement and clicks  
2. Mouse scroll and drag control  
3. Keyboard input automation  
4. Message box interactions  
5. Image recognition and matching  
6. Error handling and timeout control  
7. Window detection and management  
8. File system interaction (desktop environment)  
9. Practical automation project (MSPaint automation)

The final project (`19_pyautogui_mspaint_automation.py`) integrates multiple concepts into one structured automation workflow.

## 🎯 Final Project Summary

The MSPaint automation project demonstrates:

- Launching an application via Win + R
- Window detection and maximization
- UI interaction using image recognition
- Korean text input using clipboard workaround
- Controlled wait timing
- Safe application termination without saving

This structure closely resembles real-world RPA process automation patterns.

## ⚠ Important Notes

- Image recognition accuracy depends on screen resolution and scaling settings.
- Display scaling (125%, 150%) may cause detection failure.
- OS language affects shortcut keys (e.g., "Don't Save" key binding).
- locateOnScreen can be slow; confidence tuning is important.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

This folder represents:

✔ Foundational GUI automation skills  
✔ Understanding of event-based desktop interaction  
✔ Practical automation structure  
✔ Preparation for advanced tools (Selenium, automation frameworks, security tools)

This marks the completion of my Desktop Automation study phase.

## 🔜 Next Step

Moving forward, I plan to:

- Apply automation to browser-based workflows
- Integrate logging systems
- Improve error handling robustness
- Combine automation with cybersecurity scripting
- Build real mini RPA projects
