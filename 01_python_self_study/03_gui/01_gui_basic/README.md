GUI Basics with Tkinter

This folder contains fundamental Tkinter GUI examples created while learning Python GUI development step by step.

Each file focuses on one specific concept or widget, making it easy to understand, test, and review individual behaviors without project-level complexity.


🎯 Purpose of This Folder

The goal of 01_gui_basic is to:

Learn Tkinter one concept at a time

Understand how individual widgets behave

Practice layout management and widget interaction

Build a strong foundation before moving to a full GUI project

All examples are intentionally small, focused, and isolated.



📂 What You Will Find Here


🧱 Basic Window & Layout

Creating application windows

Setting window size and title

Using layout managers:

pack

grid

Understanding how widgets are positioned and resized


🧩 Core Widgets

Label, Button, Entry, Text

Checkbutton, Radiobutton

Listbox, Scrollbar

Combobox (ttk)

Each widget example demonstrates:

How to create it

How to read values from it

How it reacts to user interaction


🎛 Widget State & User Input

Handling widget states (normal, disabled, readonly)

Retrieving user input

Updating widget content dynamically

Understanding selection and focus behavior


📊 Progress & Feedback

Showing feedback with messagebox

showinfo

showwarning

showerror


🖼 Result Screenshots

Many examples include result screenshots (*_result.png) to visually confirm:

How the GUI looks

Whether the widget behaves as expected

This makes the folder useful even without running the code.


🧠 How to Use This Folder

Recommended learning flow:

Open one .py file at a time

Read the code and comments

Run it and interact with the GUI

Compare the behavior with the result screenshot (if available)

Modify values to see how behavior changes

These examples are ideal for quick refresh and reference.


🔗 Next Step

After completing this folder, move on to: ➡ 02_gui_project

There, all these basic concepts are combined into a complete Tkinter GUI application, including:

File selection

Layout composition

Progress tracking

Option handling

Exception handling


📌 Notes

All code is written for learning purposes

Examples are based on the Nado Coding Tkinter tutorial
