# Python Basic Fundamentals

This folder contains my complete journey through Python basic fundamentals.

It is not a collection of random scripts.
Each file represents a specific concept I learned, practiced, and verified
while building a solid foundation in Python.

This folder marks the point where I moved from
"learning syntax" to "understanding how Python code is structured and reused."

---

## 📚 What This Folder Covers

The topics in this folder include:

- Variables and data types
- String formatting and slicing
- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- Loops (for / while)
- Functions and return values
- Built-in functions
- File input/output
- Exception handling
- Python standard modules
- Custom modules and `import` mechanics

Each concept is isolated into a small, focused script
to make review and reuse easy in the future.

## 📁 File Naming Convention

Files are numbered sequentially:

01_*
02_*
03_*
...
34_*


This reflects the actual learning order
and allows me to quickly revisit any specific topic later.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Instead of memorizing syntax, I focused on:

- Understanding *why* code is written a certain way
- How Python modules are structured
- How `import` works internally
- Writing code that is readable and reusable

Every file was executed, tested, and reviewed
before being committed.

---

## 🏁 Completion Note

The final script in this folder demonstrates:

- Creating a custom Python module
- Importing it into another file
- Calling functions across files

This confirms that I understand
how Python code scales beyond a single script.

From this point forward,
my learning continues with practical projects
and external libraries.

## 🔜 What's Next

- Web scraping with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- Small automation scripts
- Command-line projects
- Project-based learning instead of isolated exercises
